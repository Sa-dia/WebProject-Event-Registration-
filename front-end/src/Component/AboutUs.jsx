        <br/>
       We are the students of batch-29 from CSE department, Jahangirnagar University. 
       This is our project on 'Event Registration System' where we setup a system to register for certain events in convenient and user-friendly way.
       Over the semester, we learnt about full-stack web-developement and used our knowledge to complete this project.<br/><br/>
       We will communicate with our clients via our website and we will help them through building them up a suitable registration system 
       according to their requirement. This project will help us, in gathering up knowledge and learning the ways of
       building up a full-stack website, as well as our clients, in successfully achieving their requirements from us.<br/><br/>
